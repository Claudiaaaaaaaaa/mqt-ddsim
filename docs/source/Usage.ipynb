    "\n",
    "The HybridQasmSimulator-Backend takes a QuantumCircuit object and uses a hybrid Schrodinger-Feynman technique to simulate the circuit in parallel using decision diagrams.\n",
    "It currently assumes that no non-unitary operations (besides measurements at the end of the circuit) are present in the circuit.\n",
    "Furthermore it always measures all qubits at the end of the circuit in the order they were defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend provides two different modes that can be set using the `mode` option:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `dd`: all computations are conducted on decision diagrams and the requested number of shots are sampled from the final decision diagram\n",
    " - `amplitude`: all individual paths in the hybrid simulation scheme are simulated using decision diagrams, while subsequent computations (addition of all results) is conducted using arrays. This requires more memory but can lead to significantly better runtime performance in many cases. The requested shots are sampled from the final statevector array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of threads to use can be set using the `nthreads` option. Note that the number of threads may be reduced when using the `amplitude` mode in order to fit the computation in the available memory."
